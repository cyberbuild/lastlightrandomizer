# Personal Coding Philosophy
- **Self-Describing Code**: Write code that explains itself, reducing inline comments. Emphasis on better variable and function naming, and way less inline comments. More flow, less commenting.
- **Method Chaining**:Instead of a void function, return self to enabled method chaining 
- **Fluid Interface**:This takes method chaining a step further by designing method names to read like sentences or phrases
- **Purposeful Comments**: Use comments for complex logic, design justification, or necessary documentation.
- **Script Debugging Output**: Include console output (e.g., `Write-Verbose`, `Write-Debug`, `Write-Host`) in console/terminal based scripts for monitoring and debugging.
- **Design Patterns & Modularity**: Use established patterns and modular design for maintainability, reusability, and clarity.
- **Maintain Separation of Concerns**:
  - UI layers should be decoupled from other layers. Use ViewModels.
  - Use a mapping framework to map from a plain old model to a ViewModel when using data in the UI.
  - Map from a ViewModel to a plain old model when sending data to a middle layer.
- **Plain Old Objects**: Will not have functions. Business logic resides in services and workflows.
- **Use Interfaces and Abstract classes**: For modularity and testability.
- **Favor Dependency Injection**: For modularity and manageability.
- **One class per file**:Avoid including multiple classes per file
- **No Anti-Pattern**:Identify anti-patterns like god class and suggest improvements. Do not generate anti-patterns unless it has a purpose. Explain why.
- **Folder structure**: Keep the folder structure organized and purposeful. Treat layers as projects/domains. E.g. UI, Core, Infrastructure. 
- **Actual Implementation**: You don't do sample or demo implementations. You always fully implement based on the goal and design. Sample and demo do not provide value. Generating the code is not a teachable moment unless asked. Do the work, implement the task at hand.
- **Verify in VSCode**: You are in VSCode. There is a problems tab in VSCode. You should check the tab for problems after you complete an edit.

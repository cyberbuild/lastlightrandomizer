Last Light Randomizer

Project Goal:
Create a mobile application to randomly set up the board for the Last Light board game, following specific rules for planet distribution.

Game Components:
- 3 concentric rings (inner, middle, outer) of different colors
- 28 planets across three size categories (small, medium, large)
- Planets feature 1-4 colors (blue, green, red, yellow)
- One special planet has all four colors

Setup Rules:
1. The number of planets placed depends on the player count (1-8 players)
2. The special planet must always be included
3. Each ring has a specific planet capacity based on player count
4. Planet placement around each ring should be evenly spaced

Player Count Configurations:
- 1 player: 5 planets total (1 outer, 3 middle, 1 inner)
- 2 players: 8 planets total (2 outer, 4 middle, 2 inner)
- 3 players: 10 planets total (3 outer, 4 middle, 3 inner)
- 4 players: 15 planets total (6 outer, 6 middle, 3 inner)
- 5 players: 19 planets total (7 outer, 8 middle, 4 inner)
- 6 players: 25 planets total (12 outer, 8 middle, 5 inner)
- 7-8 players: 26 planets total (11 outer, 10 middle, 5 inner)

Application Requirements:
- Mobile UI with color-coded rings
- Option to select player count (1-8)
- Visual representation of planets with appropriate sizes and colors
- Button to regenerate a new random setup
- Random generation of planet placements for each game
